
Approximately in the order of importance...
===========================================

- Rewrite LuceneTestCase on top of RandomizedRunner => prove it is functional.
    - UseNoMemoryExpensiveCodec
    - Locale and TimeZone randomization => per test suite? Once?
    - Disk throttling. => aspect.

- Threads [reporting uncaught exceptions, left-over threads, hangs, deadlocks, interrupting]

   * TODO: add better tracking of temporary folders. The context should carry the 
   * info about files/folders created at each lifecycle's stage and clean up early (or 
   * report the inability to do so, along with the stack trace that allocated a given file).
   * Failure to clean up properly (close all files) could also bring the test case/ 
   * suite to a failure.
   * 
   * TODO: temporary file names could be created with nasty things inside (spaces, etc.). 

- Can we integrate with TestNG too?
- How to simulate 'tests.iter.min'?
- deal with catch clauses that potentially catch assertion errors?
- What about TestRule support (introduced in 4.9?). If we rely on it explicitly, will this cause problems with older shells (ant, eclipse)?


Other things
============

RandomizedRunner currently logs all exceptions when executing tests (test exceptions, after exception, etc.). This results
in:

- Eclipse shows all exceptions next to a test case node [NICE],
- ant: shows both exceptions in xml and plain text dumps (and in reports) [NICE],
- maven shows and logs the test case multiplied for all exceptions (weird, but can be understood and all information is there),


LuceneTestCase features intentionally omitted
=============================================

tests.verbose - What's the point of this anyway? Most test hosts will buffer and redirect sysout/syserr anyway.
tempDir - Override the entire -Djava.io.tmpdir=... instead.

There is an important difference in how we repeat tests: we do full loop (hooks, test case), LTC does simple method repetitions.

test iterations (globally overriden) should always be _safe_ because they re-run entire hook chain and 
   execute on different objects. So this note from LTC should no longer apply: 
   System.out.println("WARNING: you are using -Dtests.iter=n where n > 1, not all tests support this option.");
   System.out.println("Some may crash or fail: this is not a bug.");
