===================================================

randomizedtesting-runner - A JUnit runner and base classes for testing 
    with repeatable pseudo-randomness.

junit4-ant - A <junit4> task for ANT for running tests in multiple 
    JVMs, better listener support, etc.

junit4-maven - A Maven plugin and mojos for running tests in multiple 
    JVMs, better listener support, etc. This works via integration with
    ANT, but is seamless with maven.

examples - A mini-tutorial which shows how to use randomized runner using
    increasingly more complex examples.
